          <p>
            Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with friends around the world while playing games
            online. Since childhood, founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a love of video games. Over the
            years, their friendships and connections that formed while playing grew. At the time, all they had to use for
            talking to one another were slow, unreliable tools. They knew they could make a better service that empowered
            people to bond from memories, and recreated the feeling of togetherness all found through gaming.

            So, in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People from all over the world joined. Discord
            made it easy for gamers to communicate with friends, going beyond casual talking. Friends were staying in touch
            with their various communities. Discord was unique: it was reliable communication built for gaming, and
            empowered people to create places to belong to with friends. Discord gave users a reliable and comfortable
            service to hang out with and your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began to take off and
            developed people who loved our product sprouting up around the world.
